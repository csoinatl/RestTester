# RestTester
Simple Python code for creating testable REST endpoint - Data is read from CSV file

The data for the file will be read from the CSV files in the "Data" folder.

Currently, there are only two files, and the main python code shows how to GET/POST/DELETE from the CSV files.

The intention of this project is to mimic a REST endpoint for any FE implementation, in order to set up an expectation on the values being generated by the BE and values being accepted in the FE.

Requires Python 3.x

# Execution
pip install -r requiremnts.txt
python restTester.py

# Note
This is meant as a starter project for REST endpoint tester, and should be extended out to support other data types as needed.
Quite possibly be able to improve upon it by making the calls generic

# Next steps
* Make a generic endpoints based on the data files present
* Move configuration to properties file
* Add methosd supported for a data file in a properties file
